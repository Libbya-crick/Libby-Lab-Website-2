Ashley earned her Bachelor of Arts in Molecular and Cellular Biology from Vanderbilt University. She completed her PhD in Developmental and Stem Cell Biology at the University of California - San Francisco (UCSF), working under the mentorship of Drs. Bruce Conklin and Todd McDevitt. Her doctoral research was funded by a NIH NRSA F31 Predoctoral Fellowship and focused on gastrulation patterning using induced pluripotent stem cell models, developing CRISPR-based assays, machine learning classifiers, and 3D organoid systems to study self-directed multicellular organization and morphogenesis. Ashley then joined the lab of Dr. James Briscoe at the Francis Crick Institute in London where she earned an EMBO Long-term Postdoctoral Fellowship to investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying axial stem cell fate determination. Her work combined in vivo CRISPR techniques, in vivo lineage tracing, and live imaging to uncover the genetic regulation of the stem cell populations that give rise to the neural tube. 

Ashley has continued this work in her own lab at the University of Toronto, examining how cell intrinsic fate decisions and tissue scale morphogenesis interact, forming feedback loops to connect individual to population level behaviours during neural tube formation. Her lab elaborates on techniques in bio-engineering, organoid protocol development, embryology, and genomics to create an interdisciplinary approach to address fundamental questions in developmental biology.
