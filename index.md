# <span style="color: var(--tirtiary)">Connecting molecular to morphogenic</span>

The Libby Lab is interested in understanding how tissues are generated from limited starting populations of stem cells. This process is remarkable as it involves the coordination of individual cellular units that need to interpret a complex environment, specify end fate, and physically move into place. Further, this must occur in a coordinated manner with neighbouring cells to build functional tissues. To break down the complex process of tissue generation into key components, we think about the following questions:

**1) What physical elements inform morphogenesis and tissue building?**

**2) How do stem cells interpret complex environments?** 

**3) What cell intrinsic molecular mechanisms drive stem cell specification?**

To begin to answer these questions, we use the developing spinal cord as a model examine how cell intrinsic fate decisions and tissue scale morphogenesis interact, forming feedback loops to connect population level behaviours.
